## Some Assembly Required ##

### Tired of slow web frameworks? ###

Does your website need to scale? Are you sick of adding new servers to
handle the load of your extremely popular website? Do you have a frozen
feature set and no desire to maintain your code? If so, Some Assembly
Required is the scaling solution you've been looking for.

### Upgrading from a scripting language ###

1. Manually convert your program from the slow dynamic language it is currently written in to an nginx assembly module.
2. Reconfigure nginx to serve the module.
3. Sit back and watch as your iron-level optimizations improve the speed of your site by several orders of magnitude (or less).
4. Fight all requests for new features and bug fixing with this simple phrase: "Are you kidding me? It's written in assembly! It will take months to add that new feature or track down that bug."
5. Relax.

### Example ###

Here's a [hello world example](http://github.com/dbravender/someassemblyrequired/tree/master/ngx_http_hello_world_module.s).

The example was based on code from [George Malamidis](http://nutrun.com/weblog/hello-world-nginx-module/).
